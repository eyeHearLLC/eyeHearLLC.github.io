      <h3>Promises</h3>
      <p>
        eyeHear respects your privacy. Our Privacy Policy makes a few, simple
        promises:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          eyeHear, LLC collects as little data as is possible to operate
          efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>eyeHear, LLC does not sell any personal or analytical data.</li>
        <li>
          eyeHear does not collect any recordings or captions of conversations
          captioned.
        </li>
        <li>
          eyeSpeed does not collect any speed measurements or location
          recordings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any information collected by eyeHear, LLC is documented clearly and
          thoroughly here in the privacy policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any services run by entities other than eyeHear, LLC that eyeHear, LLC
          shares information with in order to operate are documented and
          explained here in the privacy policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        eyeHear, LLC, like all businesses, operates on a foundation of
        technologies provided by other organizations. All third-party services
        are documented on a per property basis in this document.
      </p>

      <h3>eyeHear for iOS app</h3>
      <p>
        eyeHear collects as little data as possible while operating to ensure
        your privacy. We never collect your conversations contents or
        recordings. Recordings from the microphone are not stored any longer
        than it takes to process them into captions. Captions are stored locally
        on your device. eyeHear does not connect to any servers other than
        Apple's captioning service via SFSpeechRecognizer API.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          eyeHear for iOS uses Apple's SFSpeechRecognizer API. All network
          traffic between your device and Apple's servers is encrypted. You can

      <p>
        eyeHear avoids collecting user data or personally identifiable
        information (PII) as a general practice in order to ensure your privacy.
        For instance, the eyeHear app doesn't share any data at all with eyeHear
        about what you caption, or how you use the application. However, there
        are cases where we must collect PII or user data in order to offer our
        services.

      <ul>
        <li>
          eyeHear collects PII via our product surveys. This information is used
          for followup communications and product improvements. Your personal
          information is never shared with any third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          eyeHear collects PII during the course of support. The information
          collected is stored securely and minimized to the information needed
          to resolve your issue.
